        The Swiss Alps cover 64% of Switzerland’s surface, while Switzerland only covers about 15% of the Alps’ surface area. Regardless, Switzerland is the country that is most commonly associated with the Alps. The highest point in these Alps accessible by cable car is the Matterhorn.
        However, the highest summit of these Alps is the Monte Rosa, located on the Swiss-Italian border, but the highest mountain is Dom, entirely within Switzerland. The most popular activity that takes place in the Swiss Alps is hiking. Almost 23,000 kilometers of hiking trails are accessible to the public in Switzerland’s mountainous areas.

      <img src="images/jasper.png"  alt="Spirit Island Panorama">
      <h3>Geographical Location: North America</h3>
      <p>
          Spirit island, located in the heart of Maligne Lake, Jasper was a spiritual place of 
          healing for the rocky mountain tribe for over 2000 years before they were displaced in the 1900s. 
          They believed that each mountain with a face in the hall of the gods (the mountains in front of spirit island) 
          contains the essence of each god of each religion as well as all notable rocky mountain tribesmen.
      </p>
      <p>
          In 2020, there was a forest fire in a nearby forest region of Lake Maligne. Because of that forest fire, 
          the few remaining tribe members from that same rocky mountain tribe approached the Canadian government to 
          get access to Spirit Island away since they believe that the forest fire was a punishment by their gods for being 
          away from their spiritual home for so long. Now, the rocky mountain tribe works with the Canadian government to 
          perform their spiritual healing once a year.
